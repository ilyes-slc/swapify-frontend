# Swapify - Frontend

Welcome to Swapify, a React project that revolutionizes the way people exchange their products by implementing a swipe-based interface, similar to Tinder. With Swapify, you can effortlessly discover and swap products with other users in a fun and interactive manner.

## Features

- **Swipe Interface:** Enjoy a Tinder-like swiping experience to discover and choose products.

## JWT Authentication

Swapify uses JWT authentication to ensure a secure and seamless user experience. Follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. **Generate JWT Secret:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    - Add a secure JWT secret to the file: `REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET=mySecretKey`.

2. **User Registration:**
    - Implement a user registration system to store user data securely.
    - Utilize the JWT secret to generate tokens upon successful registration.

3. **User Login:**
    - Implement a login system using email and password.
    - Upon successful login, generate a JWT token and store it securely on the client side.

4. **Authentication Middleware:**
    - Protect routes that require authentication using middleware.
    - Verify the JWT token on the server side to ensure a valid and authenticated user.

5. **Token Expiry and Refresh:**
    - Implement token expiry to enhance security.
    - Provide a token refresh mechanism to ensure uninterrupted user sessions.
